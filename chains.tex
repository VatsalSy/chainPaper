\begin{abstract}
The collision of liquid jets and formation of a sheet in the median plane is illustrated numerically, which subsequently transforms into a chain like fluidic structure with successive dwarf links in mutually orthogonal planes. Flow kinematics is studied with self-similar velocity profile and streamlines to understand the behavior of fluid parcels inside the chain. With the numerical analysis over a wide range of operating parameters, a correlation has been proposed to predict the shape of the links in the chain. Citing analogy between the impact of rims for the formation of elemental links and traversal of damped billiard balls after the collision, an attempt has been made to understand the fundamental physics of this phenomenon through force balance. Finally, the formation of higher order links is proposed as equivalent to the collision between jets of reduced strengths and smaller impingement angles.

Interactions between liquid jets have invoked the curiosity of researchers with their ubiquitous presence, even in the scientific artworks by Leonardo Da Vinci in the 16$^{th}$ century. Physics of interaction related to liquid jets is classically summarized in a recent effort by \cite{eggers2008physics}. \cite{bush2004collision} introduced several regimes to characterize the different flow structures obtained from such collisions. At moderate flow rates, laminar jets may lead to the formation of a stable liquid sheet bounded by a thick rim \citep{yang2014liquid}. Figure~\ref{Figure::schematic}(a) illustrates this structure termed as the liquid chain with the complementary orthogonal sheets forming the different links. The stable chain regime is not just an idealization of the violent flapping \citep{villermaux2002life}, but also holds physical significance for the exploration of fundamental physics behind atomization \citep{bremond2006atomization}. Moreover, these structures can be used as wall-free continuous reactors \citep{erni2013free} and are often used as a canonical arrangement for generation of liquid sheets \citep{bush2004collision,taylor1960formation}.\\
Keeping these fascinating applications in mind, a range of experimental works can be found exploring the formation of stable liquid sheets using viscous jets \citep{choo2001parametric,choo2002velocity,bush2004collision}. Complementing experimental findings, as a part of their study, \cite{chen2013high} have shown the formation of liquid chain using Finite Volume based Volume of Fluid (VOF) framework. Recently, \cite{da2016surface} also demonstrated the formation of liquid chain using Boundary Element Method (BEM) but only for inviscid fluids.\\
Critical assessment of literature reveals that an in-depth study of fluid chain regime is still due which can explore fundamental physics behind the formation of primary link and establish a relation between successive diminishing links. A major challenge that lies in the prediction of the chain-like structure is the proper resolution of the sheet (approximately $1/100^{th}$ of jet diameter; figure~\ref{Figure::schematic}(b)) between the rims. In the present work, we study the overall behavior of the fluid chain numerically, while focusing on the physics of flow for the primary link by analyzing the dimensional characteristics and velocity field. In the next section, the numerical framework employed in this work is briefly explained.
\section{Numerical framework}
The collision of liquid jets has been studied in three-dimensional finite volume framework. Open source, time-dependent, multi-fluid, Navier-Stokes solver, Gerris is used for the current study \citep{popinet2009}. The spatial discretization of the domain is undertaken using an octree based structured hierarchical grid system, locally refined near the interface. Conventional mass and momentum conservation equations for incompressible flow have been solved in presence of interface specific surface tension force and gravitational field. The interface tracking is undertaken using the VOF approach using volume fraction of liquid. The details of solution procedure can be found in the work of \cite{popinet2009}.\\
The computational domain is also illustrated in figure~\ref{Figure::schematic}(a) with parabolic inflow (average velocity, $u_j$) of jets (diameter, $d_j$ and impingement angle, $2\alpha$) and boundary outflow elsewhere. From the works of \cite{choo2001parametric}, it can be shown that the thickness of liquid sheet follows $\frac{hr}{d_j^2} \sim 1$, for $2\alpha \in \{0,\pi/2\}$.  Here, $r$ is the radial direction originating from the collision point of the jets and $h$ is the measurement of the thickness of the film produced. We maintained $\frac{d_j}{\delta l} \sim 10\frac{r_{max}}{d_j}$ to choose minimum cell size $\left(\delta l\right)$ and perform grid independence study. The factor of 10 is included to have at least 10 grid points \citep{ling2015multiscale} across the smallest length scale for the structure to avoid breakage of sheet \citep{chen2013high}. To obtain continuous liquid film and well-resolved phenomenon, $\delta l$ is varied to match the above-mentioned criteria. In one representative simulation, we show the effect of variation of $\delta l$, in figure~\ref{Figure::gisetal}(a), on sheet profile and velocity pattern of the jet. It can be observed that at $\frac{d_j}{\delta l}$ = 102.4, well resolved film is obtained with acceptable computational cost ($\sim 50\%$ less than $\frac{d_j}{\delta l}$ = 204.8). Mesh structure around different critical parts of the chain is shown in figure~\ref{Figure::gisetal}(b) which establishes sufficiency of grid points even inside smallest thickness of the film. To check the accuracy of the developed mesh structure, results from simulations are compared (figure~\ref{Figure::gisetal}(c)) with experimental observations of sheet profile reported by \cite{bush2004collision}. So as to get quantitative validation, the variation of liquid volume flux inside the sheet is also plotted in figure~\ref{Figure::gisetal}(c) along with \cite{bush2004collision}. In both the cases, matching between present numerical simulations and pioneering experimental result by \cite{bush2004collision} provides confidence for the numerical understanding of the phenomenon, in our work. Further, on performing non-dimensional analysis, it can be observed that Froude number ($Fr = u_j/\sqrt{gd_j}$), Bond number ($Bo = \rho gd_j^2/\sigma$) and ratio between Reynolds number and jet Froude number ($Re/Fr = \rho\sqrt{gd_j^3}/\mu$) govern the shape and sizes of different links in the fluid chain structure.

\section{Collision and sheet formation}
As the laminar liquid jets collide, a thin sheet bounded by thicker rims is formed in the median plane, perpendicular to the axes of the jets. In this section, the formation process of chain structure due to the collision of liquid jets is discussed. Figure~\ref{Figure::GenesisNvelo}(a) shows temporal evolution of the fluid sheet when the two jets collide. The fluid parcels are dispatched radially outwards from the point of impingement. This along with net inertia of jets and gravity results in a bay leaf like sheet as shown in figures~\ref{Figure::GenesisNvelo}(a)(i) and~\ref{Figure::GenesisNvelo}(a)(ii). Present zone of consideration lies in 0.5 $< Fr <$ 4, where gravity plays a major role unlike \cite{bush2004collision,bremond2006atomization}.
In absence of surface tension or at very high Weber number, the sheet keeps on expanding (figure~\ref{Figure::GenesisNvelo}(a)(iii)), leading to the formation of the open rim structures \citep{taylor1960formation,chen2013high}. As the sheet closes onto itself, the two rims at the periphery undergo a second oblique collision (figure~\ref{Figure::GenesisNvelo}(a)(iv)) at an angle smaller than the initial collision (figure~\ref{Figure::GenesisNvelo}(a)(i)). After the secondary impingement, similar to figure~\ref{Figure::GenesisNvelo}(a)(ii), a flow biased sheet begins to develop (figure~\ref{Figure::GenesisNvelo}(a)(v)). Formation of this secondary link has no effect on the characteristics features of the primary link as the sheet speed is supercritical \citep{bush2004collision}, and therefore can be independently studied. Temporal advancement result in the formation of a full-fledged secondary link is shown in figures~\ref{Figure::GenesisNvelo}(a)(vi) and~\ref{Figure::GenesisNvelo}(a)(vii). It must be noted that the plane of formation of this sheet is orthogonal to that of the primary link and therefore the secondary link shares the same plane as the axes of the jets. The process continues and a series of mutually orthogonal links are obtained, successively reducing in size until a long single liquid jet is formed \citep{bush2004collision}. After the initial transients, links become steady (non-dimensionalized time, $T \left(\frac{u_jt}{d_j}\right) = $ 8.5 as representation in primary link) which has been analyzed further. Account of primary link length and shown in inset of Figure establishes steady nature.\\

	\label{Figure::GenesisNvelo}%\vspace{-2mm}
\end{figure}
The thin, fast moving sheet possess radial velocity pattern emerging from a stagnation point, $\delta_\pi$ higher than the impingement location. \cite{inamura2014effect} have established $\delta_\pi = \lambda d_j/(2\sin\alpha)$, where the factor $\lambda$ is a function of the impingement angle. Considering $\delta_\pi$ and velocity vectors obtained from numerical simulations for two sets of non-dimensional numbers, flow pattern inside the sheet is reported in figure~\ref{Figure::GenesisNvelo}(b). It can be observed that velocity vectors follow a self-similar smooth path, as traced by sheet boundary. An increase of sheet span can be also noticed from the figure for a higher velocity of impacting jets.  
An effort has been made to observe the steady average flow $\left(u_f(r,\theta)\right)$ across the thickness of the sheet at a given radial and azimuthal point. It can be expressed %in equation~\ref{Equation::uf}.
as $u_f(r,\theta) = \int_{0}^{1}\sqrt{V_iV_i}d(Y/h)$, where $Y$ is the direction parallel to thickness of the primary link.
%$u_f(r,\theta) = \int_{0}^{1}\sqrt{V_iV_i}d(Y/h)$. 
%\begin{equation}\label{Equation::uf}
%u_f(r,\theta) = \int_{0}^{1}\sqrt{V_iV_i}d(Y/h)
%\end{equation}
Variation of $u_f(r,\theta)$ along radial plane at different azimuthal angles have been shown in the inset of figure~\ref{Figure::GenesisNvelo}(c). It can be observed that the order of change in the fluid velocity across the radial distance from the point of impact is less than the change across the azimuthal direction (also discussed by \cite{choo2002velocity}). Further, sheet velocity $\left(u_s(\theta)\right)$ along a radial plane has been also obtained by integrating $u_f(r,\theta)$ as $u_s(\theta) = \int_{0}^{1}u_f(r,\theta)d(r/r_{max})$.  %: %$u_s(\theta) = \int_{0}^{1}u_f(r,\theta)d(r/r_{max})$.
%\begin{equation}\label{Equation::us}
%u_s(\theta) = \int_{0}^{1}u_f(r,\theta)d(r/r_{max})
%\end{equation} 
Upon non-dimensionalization of sheet velocity with its average $\left(u_0\right)$, a self-similar behavior in azimuthal direction is observed for a wide diversity of non-dimensional parameters reported in figure~\ref{Figure::GenesisNvelo}(c). In this figure, four arbitrarily chosen parameters are shown which adheres to a function relationship of $u_s(\theta)$ in the following fashion: 
\begin{equation}\label{Equation::usu0}
u_s(\theta)/u_0 = 1.03 + 0.13\cos(0.052\theta)
\end{equation}
Once the average sheet velocity exceeds a critical value, the chain structure is no longer stable as the  Kelvin - Helmholtz instability kicks in \citep{villermaux2002life}. \\

	\label{Figure::streamDetails}%%\vspace{-2.75mm}
\end{figure}
An overall look of three-dimensional chain structure (figure~\ref{Figure::streamDetails}(c)) allows us to obtain velocity patterns at different axial locations. The streamlines follow steadily the phase contour boundary, with those inside the chain structure going in trajectories similar to the outer boundary as shown in figures~\ref{Figure::streamDetails}(a) and~\ref{Figure::streamDetails}(e). Figure~\ref{Figure::streamDetails}(b) puts an effort towards highlighting velocity vectors at primary, secondary and tertiary links. One can observe from figure~\ref{Figure::streamDetails}(b) that the spread of liquid influence at collision planes is reducing continuously as $X/d_j$ increases.  At $X/d_j$ = 0, the liquid jets converge onto themselves (B-B') marked by retracting velocity field, whereas the liquid sheet grows (A-A') in the Z direction, marked by an expanding velocity field. Similar trends are observed at all collision planes leading to the formation of three visible links in this case (figure~\ref{Figure::streamDetails}(c)). The velocity vector magnitudes go on increasing at each subsequent collision planes as the gravitational head is converted to dynamic head leading to narrowing of the extent of liquid phase boundary in the XZ plane. In the primary link, this converging-diverging trend of velocity vectors is continued from above the first collision point ($X/d_j$ = 0) to the plane where the extent of the link perpendicular to the net flow direction in the plane of the link is maximum ($X/d_j$ = 3.12). As illustrated in figure~\ref{Figure::streamDetails}(d), the streamlines at the location of maximum width imply that the component of velocity perpendicular to the liquid sheet phase boundary is zero. This results in the formation of distinguished circulation patterns inside the lobes at the locations of the maximum extent corresponding to the three links visible in this case. Reduction of collision strength at different planes explains diminishing spans of the links, which can be also seen from sheet cross-sectional images (figure~\ref{Figure::streamDetails}(d)). A characteristic twist can be found in streamlines (figure~\ref{Figure::streamDetails}(f)) as the flow propagates downstream through the locations of subsequent collisions. The twist occurs as the fluid parcels are restricted by surface tension to follow the chain outer periphery. These twists are prominent until viscous effects take charge and only a single jet of liquid is left at the end of the chain structure. These viscous forces lead to dissipation of energy as the liquids jets (or rims for the post-primary link) collide with each other. It is clear from our discussions above that, different flow parameters, characterized by non-dimensional numbers play a crucial role in the determination of the three-dimensional stable chain structures and therefore, the next section is devoted to analyzing such effects.
\section{Assessment of factors influencing chain structure}

	\label{Figure::phaseContours}%\vspace{-3mm}
\end{figure}
Formation of the liquid sheet bounded by the rims is governed by inertia, viscous, buoyancy and surface forces apart from the angle of impingement between the jets ($\alpha$). The combination of these forces forms $Fr$, $Bo$ and $Re/Fr$, described above. In this section, critical assessment of chain shapes is investigated for various non-dimensional numbers and impingement angles. \cite{yang2014liquid} acknowledged the importance of these parametric variations on collision process and formation of the first link. Figures~\ref{Figure::phaseContours}(a) -~\ref{Figure::phaseContours}(d) show numerical chain structure for a diversity of $\alpha$, $Fr$, $Bo$ and $Re/Fr$. An increase in impingement angle leads to decrement in jet momentum in direction of gravity ($u_j\cos\alpha$) and that perpendicular to the median plane increases, leading to substantial increase in width of the sheet, keeping the length more or less intact (figures~\ref{Figure::phaseContours}(a)). Alternatively, as the jet momentum is increased (increase in $Fr$), the resulting links formed are bigger (figure~\ref{Figure::phaseContours}(b)) accommodating expansion tendencies due to fluid inertia. One can clearly see this effect is transmitted to the subsequent links as well. Further, surface tension is a crucial entity which keeps a check on the expansion tendencies of the link. As the surface tension is decreased ($Bo$ increased), the link can expand until inertial and centrifugal forces balance it. This justifies obtaining larger links for higher values of $Bo$ as seen in figures~\ref{Figure::phaseContours}(c). As the surface tension is increased (low $Bo$ regime), the system tries to go towards the minimum surface energy decreasing the dimensions of the corresponding links (link in figure~\ref{Figure::phaseContours}(c) from $Bo$ = 6 to 2). Further, the collision of cylindrical jets and rims is also observed to be influenced by viscous dissipations. Decreasing the viscosity (increasing $Re/Fr$) leads to considerable increase in sheet dimensions but its effect saturates at lower ranges of liquid viscosities (figure~\ref{Figure::phaseContours}(d)). Effect of change in liquid viscosity dies down as inertia and surface tension overshadows its resistance to form similar shape and sizes of links. It can also be noticed that it is the viscous dissipations that result in the decrement in the size of subsequent links leading to a point where the sheet losses its identity, giving rise to a single jet of fluid. The effect is prominent in figure~\ref{Figure::phaseContours}(d) for $Re/Fr$ = 12.5.\\
Considering $\Delta Z$ is the rim to rim distance at a particular vertical location ($X$) of the symmetric sheet, a third order polynomial is used to fit ($R^2 >$ 0.975; $SSE <$ 0.01) the sheet shape for various influencing parameters. The functional form of the polynomial is: 
\begin{equation}\label{Equation::correlation}
\Delta Z/(2d_j) = \sum_{n = 0}^{n = 3}p_n(X/d_j)^n
%\frac{\Delta Z}{2d_j} = \sum_{n = 0}^{n = 3}p_n\left(\frac{X}{d_j}\right)^n
\end{equation}
Efforts are also made to relate polynomial coefficients $\left(p_n\right)$ with non-dimensional numbers using linear regression analysis. Hence, $p_n$ can be expressed as
\begin{equation}\label{Equation::CorelationCoefficeints}
p_n = C_{0,n}\left(\sin\alpha\right)^{C_{1,n}}\left(Fr\right)^{C_{2,n}}\left(Bo\right)^{C_{3,n}}\left(Re\right)^{C_{4,n}}
\end{equation}
Values of $C_{m,n} \left(\forall\:\: m \in \{0,4\}\right)$ in equation~\ref{Equation::CorelationCoefficeints} are tabulated in the inset of figure~\ref{Figure::phaseContours}(e) obeying $R^2$ norm of regression higher than 0.925. Predictability of the correlation with numerical chain contours are shown in the insets of figure~\ref{Figure::phaseContours}(e) for two different cases of non-dimensional numbers. It can be also observed from figure~\ref{Figure::phaseContours}(e) that developed correlation gives a very good match ($\pm$5\%) with the numerical sheet profiles. So as to check the capability of the correlation, for prediction of experimental profiles of the chain structure, the comparison is made between observation of \cite{bush2004collision} and equation~\ref{Equation::correlation}. The reported excellent match in the inset of figure~\ref{Figure::phaseContours}(e) confirms the universality of the developed correlation. It is essential to understand the formation physics of widely influenced sheet structure generated due to the collision of jets. Next section dedicatedly discusses the issue.

\section{Analogy of chain formation}	
To understand the physical insights of the liquid jet collision, idealizations are made for tracing back the sheet profile as a resultant of collision between two identical billiard balls (mass $m$) in the plane of the sheet. The follow-up trajectory of the balls after the collision is considered damped so as to mimic resistive forces like viscous and surface tension. A free body diagram and schematic of the billiard ball collision assumption to replicate the sheet structure is depicted in figure~\ref{Figure::analytical}(a). Apart from inertial and gravitational forces, on the ball, a damping force of magnitude $f_n$ (to impose the effect of viscous dissipation and surface forces) is also attached in the direction perpendicular to the individual ball instantaneous velocity, post collision. Absence of these resistive forces will make infinitely stretched sheet \citep{taylor1960formation}, with $f_n$ = 0 case. Reference frame for the trajectory of the ball ($\zeta$) is considered to have origin at point of collision with $\zeta$ = 0 at $X$ = 0. Free body force analysis of the ball, post-collision can be expressed as equation~\ref{Equation::forceBal}, with accelerations $a_n$ and $a_t$ in normal and tangential directions respectively.
\begin{equation}
	\label{Equation::forceBal}	
	a_t = v_{ball}\frac{dv_{ball}}{ds} = g\cos\phi;\:\:\:\:\:\:\:
	a_n = g\sin\phi + \frac{f_n}{m} = \frac{v_{ball}^2}{r_c}
\end{equation}
%\begin{subequations}%
%	\begin{eqnarray}
%	\label{Equation::tangential}
%	\text{Direction t:}\:\:\: a_t = v_{ball}\frac{dv_{ball}}{ds} &=& g\cos\phi\\
%	\label{Equation::normal}
%	\text{Direction n:}\:\:\: a_n = g\sin\phi + \frac{f_n}{m} &=& \frac{v_{ball}^2}{r_c}
%	\end{eqnarray}
%\end{subequations}
\begin{figure}%
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.675\linewidth]{Figure6}
	\caption{Billiard ball collision analogy: (a) schematic of the model and free-body diagram and comparison between the link shape obtained through numerical simulations and the billiard ball trajectory ($\zeta$, \protect\MarkerSquareRed) for ($\alpha$, $Fr$, $Re/Fr$, $Bo$) = (a) (30$\degree$, 2.5, 34, 5), (b) (30$\degree$, 2.5, 23, 3.85), (d) (30$\degree$, 2, 34, 4.56) and (e) (45$\degree$, 2, 34, 3.4).}
	\label{Figure::analytical}
\end{figure}%
Here, $r_c$ is the radius of curvature in $\zeta-X$ plane and $\phi = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{d\zeta}{dX}\right)$. Integrating tangential momentum equation with increment $ds = dX/\cos\phi$ along with boundary condition at $X$ = 0, instantaneous ball velocity ($v_{ball}$) can be obtained as $\sqrt{u_j^2 + 2gX}$. Rearrangement of momentum equation in the normal direction after defining $\Lambda$ as $f_n/(mg)$ and inertial length scale, $\chi$ equivalent to $u_j^2/(2g)$, one obtains:
\begin{equation}\label{Equation::Final1}
r_c\left(\sin\phi + \Lambda\right) = 2(X + \chi)
\end{equation} 
After necessary integration, equation~\ref{Equation::Final1} simplifies to:
\begin{equation}
\sin\phi  = \sin\alpha + \left(\Lambda + \sin\alpha\right)\left(1/\sqrt{X/\chi + 1} - 1\right)	
%\sin\phi  = \sin\alpha + \left(\Lambda + \sin\alpha\right)\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{X/\chi + 1}} - 1\right)	
\end{equation}
Recalling that $\tan\phi = \frac{d\zeta}{dX}$ and expressing $\Lambda/\sin\alpha = \eta$, profile of billiard ball movement can be characterized as:
\begin{equation}
\label{Equation::AnaFinal}
%\frac{d\zeta}{dX} = \tan\left\lbrace\sin^{-1}\left[ \sin\phi_0\left(1 + \eta\right)\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{X/\chi + 1}} - 1\right) \right]\right\rbrace
\frac{d\zeta}{dX} = \tan\left\lbrace\sin^{-1}\left[ \sin\phi_0\left(1 + \eta\right)\left(1/\sqrt{X/\chi + 1} - 1\right) \right]\right\rbrace
\end{equation}
The functional form of the ball trajectory, equivalence of sheet profile, can be integrated numerically to obtain the coordinate points in the $\zeta-X$ plane after tuning only control factor, $\eta$ from some simulated profiles. In this process, $L^1$ relative error norm is kept below 10\%. Efforts have been also made to express control parameter, $\eta$ in terms of non-dimensional numbers for the range of values presented in this work. With 99\% $R^2$ regression norm, $\eta$ can be related with non-dimensional numbers as:
\begin{equation}\label{Equation::eta}
\eta = 3.28(\sin\alpha)^{-0.077}(Fr)^{0.502}(Bo)^{-0.248}\left(Re\right)^{-0.084}
\end{equation}
Proposed concept of collision of billiard balls for mimicking the sheet profile is also tested with phase contours of numerical simulations. Some representative matches are shown in figure~\ref{Figure::analytical}(b) -~\ref{Figure::analytical}(e) in connection of primary link. Fundamental analysis of forces, a single controlling parameter in sheet profile (equation~\ref{Equation::AnaFinal}) and an excellent match with numerical data supplies in-depth knowledge about the genesis of the liquid chain. Next, we focus on the mutual relationship between links formed at successive orthogonal planes.

The secondary and tertiary links observed in mutually perpendicular planes initiate with the collision of rims in preceding links. From our numerous simulations in the wide range of operating parameters, it can be observed that secondary, tertiary and subsequent links of a chain are equivalent to primary, secondary and subsequent links of another chain having different operating parameters. Hence, it is proposed that subsequent links are equivalent to resultant of collision between two free jets having reduced strength. To establish our claim, in figure~\ref{Figure::secondCollision}(a), a representative chain structure is identified for $\alpha$ = 30$\degree$, $Fr$ = 2.5, $Bo$ = 4, $Re/Fr$ = 34 (Case 1), in which secondary links showed resemblance with primary link of $\alpha$ = 25$\degree$, $Fr$ = 2.2, $Bo$ = 4, $Re/Fr$ = 34 (Case 2). Continuing this one can also establish analogy among tertiary link of Case 1, secondary link of Case 2 and primary link of $\alpha$ = 11.25$\degree$, $Fr$ = 1.98, $Bo$ = 4, $Re/Fr$ = 34 (Case 3). One to one correspondence of these links of different cases establishing present proposal is shown in the comparative graph of figure~\ref{Figure::secondCollision}(a). It can be commented that subsequent links are reduced in size, giving a feeling of resultant of impact between two lesser strength jets. The analogy of interconnected links in a chain with one level lesser link in another chain is found to be valid with $\pm$ 10\% confidence for the entire region of search space of the operating parameters ($\alpha$, $Fr$, $Re/Fr$, $Bo$). A critical assessment of links in chain structure and rim profile have also established that angle of impingement between rims successively reduces $\alpha_{n}/\alpha_{n-1} < 1 \:\:\forall\:\: n = 1, 2, 3 \:\:\text{and higher integers}$. It has been also checked that analogy of collision between billiard balls and formation of the link by the interaction between rims is also valid after taking the reduction of angle of impingement into consideration. This idea we have established in figure~\ref{Figure::secondCollision}(b) -~\ref{Figure::secondCollision}(c) for secondary and tertiary links for few chain cases randomly scattered in search space. With only $\pm$ 10\% error, theory of collision between billiard balls (equations~\ref{Equation::AnaFinal} -~\ref{Equation::eta}) has also found to be applicable for $n^{th}$ order link of chain. Polynomial proposed in equation~\ref{Equation::correlation} also predicts genesis of $n^{th}$ order link satisfactorily with modified strength and impingement angle. Clustering of points near (1,1) for secondary link (figure~\ref{Figure::secondCollision}(b)) and (0,0) for tertiary link (figure~\ref{Figure::secondCollision}(c)) establishes continuous reduction of impingement angle $\alpha_{n}$ with increase in link number $n$. Besides the reduction in angle of impingements, the interaction between rims of a link also can be considered as the collision between jets of lesser Froude number ($Fr_m$) than $Fr_j$. The monotonous decrement of $Fr_m$ is observed as one traverses in subsequent higher level links along a chain. Figure~\ref{Figure::secondCollision}(d) establishes this idea where ratio between rim Froude number of secondary link ($Fr_2$) to jet Froude number ($Fr_j$) has been fitted as 0.88 and that of same for tertiary link ($Fr_3/Fr_j$) as 0.8. Though idea of inter-relation between links is established only for first three, it can be extrapolated for higher order elements in the chain until it transforms to jet.
\section{Conclusion}
Numerical simulations showed that individual links, formed by collision of cylindrical jets (primary) or rims (secondary onward), occupy mutually orthogonal planes with a successive reduction in size owing to viscous effects. The fluid parcels inside these links are dispatched radially outwards from the stagnation point and follow trajectories self-similar to the phase boundary. The inertial and gravitational forces provide a measure of the expansion of these sheets counteracted by the surface tension at the interface and viscous dissipations at the subsequent collisions. These symmetric sheet profile can be modeled using a third order polynomial, at an accuracy of $\pm$ 5\%, with coefficients dependent on various non-dimensional numbers featuring the interplay of different forces. Effects of these forces have been understood by mimicking them onto the post-collision trajectory of billiard balls. Higher order links are found to be similar to lower or primary level element formed due to impact between jets of reduced $Fr$ and $\alpha$.
