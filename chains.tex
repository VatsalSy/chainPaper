\section{Introduction}
Interactions of liquid jets have invoked the curiosity of researchers with their ubiquitous presence, eminent even in the scientific artworks by Leonardo Da Vinci in the 16$^{th}$ century. Physics of different types of interactions related to liquid jets is classically summarized in a recent effort by \cite{eggers2008physics}. One of these interactions is the collision between liquid jets, presented by \cite{rayleigh1879capillary}. \cite{bush2004collision} introduced several regimes to characterize the different flow structures obtained from such collisions, working on the theory of liquid jet impingement given by \cite{taylor1960formation}. At low velocities or narrow angles of impingement, jets may coalesce to form a unified one or bounce off due to presence of a thin film of air between them \cite{wadhwa2013noncoalescence}. On increasing the flow rates, laminar jets may lead to formation of a stable liquid sheet bounded by a thick rim \cite{yang2014liquid}. Inertia and gravitational forces act to expand the liquid sheet formed but the action of surface tension puts a check and allows the sheet  to converge, such that the successive collisions of the thick rims downstream of the flow result in formation of mutually orthogonal liquid sheets \cite{bush2004collision}. Figure illustrates this structure termed as the liquid chain with the complementary orthogonal sheets forming the different links. Alternatively, further increase in jet velocity, due to several instability modes, leads towards ejection of droplets from the liquid rim \cite{bremond2006atomization}, fluid fishbones \cite{bush2004collision} and flapping sheet \cite{villermaux2002life} associated with atomized drops \cite{ibrahim1991impinging}. The stable chain regime is not just an idealization of the violent flapping, but also holds physical significance for the exploration of fundamental physics behind atomization. Moreover, these structures can be used as wall-free continuous reactors \cite{erni2013free} and are often used as a canonical arrangement for generation of liquid sheets \cite{dombrowski1954photographic}. Keeping this fascinating applications in mind, a range of  experimental works can be found exploring the formation of stable liquid sheets using viscous jets \cite{choo2001parametric,choo2002velocity,bush2004collision,inamura2014effect}. Using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique, radial streamlines are observed near the point of impingement and the fluid parcels travel towards the periphery resulting in the formation of the thick rim due to fluid accumulation \cite{choo2002velocity,bush2004collision}. The rim is stable as long as the curvature force developed by surface tension provides the necessary centripetal acceleration as the fluid packets in the rim accelerate owing to loss in gravitational potential \cite{bremond2006atomization}. On balancing the two, \cite{taylor1960formation} developed an expression for the sheet radius which has been found to describe the experimental results of \cite{bush2004collision} reasonably well. Emphasis has been also given by \cite{bush2004collision} for prediction of shapes of leaf like links forming chain structure.  
However, the model requires input from the experiments so as to close the system of differential equations. Isolated numerical efforts are also found describing different possible outcomes due to liquid jets interactions. As a part of their study, \cite{ma2011atomization,chen2013high} have shown formation of liquid chain using Finite Volume based Volume of Fluid (VOF) network. Recently, \cite{da2016surface} also demonstrated formation of liquid chain using Boundary Element Method (BEM). But, their exhibition of chain like structure along with other physical jet related structures suffer from inviscid assumption. Critical assessment of literature reveals that an in-depth study of fluid chain regime is still due which can explore fundamental physics behind formation of primary link and establish relation between successive diminishing links.  Major challenge that lies in the prediction of chain like structure is the proper resolution of sheet (approximately $1/100^{th}$ of jet diameter) between the rims, which are supposed to mingle once again for forming next link in mutually perpendicular plane. Figure 1b is presented to demonstrate the presence of  a range of length scales in such a simplistic fluid link.  In the present work, we attempt at study of an overall behavior of the fluid chain  while focusing on the physics of flow for the primary link by analyzing the dimensional characteristics and velocity fields. Special attention is given to the second and third collisions, leading to the formation of the subsequent mutually orthogonal links and relate them from fundamental force balance. In the next section, the numerical framework employed in this work is briefly explained before reporting mesh sensitivity analysis and validation.

\section{Numerical framework}
Collision of liquid jets has been studied in three-dimensional  finite volume framework. Open source, time-dependent, multi-fluid, Navier-Stokes solver, Gerris is used for the current study \citep{Popinet2003}. The spatial discretization of the domain is undertaken using an octree based structured hierarchical grid system, locally refined near the interface. Conventional mass and momentum conservation equations for incompressible flow have been solved in presence of interface specific surface tension force ($\sigma \kappa$, where $\sigma$ is the surface tension coefficient and $\kappa$ denotes the curvature of the interface) and gravitational field ($\rho g$). The interface tracking is undertaken using the Volume Of Fluid (VOF) approach using volume fraction of liquid, defined as $\Psi(x_i, t)$, at the spatial and temporal instance of $x_i$ and $t$ respectively. Therefore, the density and viscosity for the study can be described using Equation~\ref{Equation::general}.
\begin{equation} \label{Equation::general}
	A (\Psi) = \Psi A_1 + (1-\Psi)A_2 \: \: \:  \forall  \: A \in \{\rho, \mu\}
\end{equation}
The VOF approach is implemented in a two-step process of interface reconstruction (based on the values of $\Psi$ and piecewise linear interface construction scheme, PLIC) along with geometric flux computation and interface advection, shown in Equation~\ref{Equation::vof}.
\begin{equation} \label{Equation::vof}
	\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial(\Psi V_i)}{\partial X_i} = 0
\end{equation}
Gerris uses second order accurate time discretization of momentum and continuity equations with time splitting algorithm as proposed by \cite{Chorin1968}, whereby an unconditionally stable corrector predictor time marching approach is adopted. A multi-grid solver is used for solution of the resulting pressure-velocity coupled Laplace equation. The advection term of the momentum equation $\left(V_k\frac{\partial V_i}{\partial X_k}\right)$ is estimated using the Bell-Colella-Glaz second-order unsplit upwind scheme \citep{bell1989second}, which requires the restriction to be set up on the time step. Following \cite{popinet2009}, time step has been determined to satisfy Courant-Friedrich-Lewy (CFL) stability criteria of less than unity. The details of solution procedure can be found in the works of \cite{Popinet2003,popinet2009}.\\
The computational domain is also illustrated in Figure~\ref{Figure::schematic}a with parabolic inflow (average velocity, $u_j$) of jets (diameter, $d_j$ and impingement angle, $2\alpha$) and boundary outflow elsewhere. From the works of \cite{choo2001parametric}, it can be easily shown that the thickness of liquid sheet follows $\frac{hr}{d_j^2} \sim 1$, for $2\alpha \in \{0,\pi/2\}$.  Here, $r$ is the radial direction originating from the collision point of the jets and h is the measurement of thickness of the film produced by jet collision. We maintained $\frac{d_j}{\delta l} \sim 10\frac{r_{max}}{d_j}$ to choose minimum cell size $\left(\delta l\right)$ and perform Grid Independence Study (GIS). The factor of 10 is included to have at least 10 grid points\citep{ling2015multiscale} across the smallest length scale for the structure to avoid breakage of sheet \citep{chen2013high}. To obtain continuous liquid film and well resolved phenomenon, $\delta l$ is varied to match the above mentioned criteria. In one representative simulation, we show the effect of variation of $\delta l$, in Figure~\ref{Figure::gisetal}a, on sheet profile and velocity pattern of the jet. It can be observed that at $\frac{d_j}{\delta l}$ = 102.4, well resolved film is obtained with acceptable computational cost ($\sim 50\%$ less than $\frac{d_j}{\delta l}$ = 204.8). Mesh structure around different critical parts of the chain is shown in Figure~\ref{Figure::gisetal}b which establishes sufficiency of grid points even inside smallest thickness of the film. To check the accuracy of the developed mesh structure, results from simulations are compared (Figure~\ref{Figure::gisetal}c) with experimental observations of sheet profile reported by \cite{bush2004collision}. So as to get quantitative validation, variation of liquid volume flux inside the sheet is also plotted in Figure~\ref{Figure::gisetal} along with \cite{bush2004collision}. In both the cases, matching between present numerical simulations and pioneering experimental result by \cite{bush2004collision} provides confidence for numerical understanding of the phenomenon, in our work. Further, on performing non-dimensional analysis, it can be observed that Froude number $\left(Fr = \frac{u_j}{\sqrt{gd_j}}\right)$, Bond number $\left(Bo = \frac{\rho gd_j^2}{\sigma}\right)$ and ratio between Reynolds number and jet Froude number $\left(Re/Fr = \frac{\rho\sqrt{gd_j^3}}{\mu}\right)$ govern the shape and sizes of different links in the fluid chain structure. In our next section, detailed effort has been presented to investigate formation of chain based on above non-dimensional numbers.
\section{Collision and Sheet Formation}
As the laminar liquid jets collide, a thin sheet bounded by thicker rims is formed in the median plane, perpendicular to the axes of the jets. In this section, the formation process of chain structure due to the collision of liquid jets is discussed. Figure~\ref{Figure::transient} shows temporal evolution of the fluid sheet when the two jets collide. The fluid parcels are dispatched radially outwards from the point of impingement. This along with net inertia of jets and gravity results in a bay leaf like sheet as shown in Figures~\ref{Figure::transient}b and~\ref{Figure::transient}c. Present zone of consideration lies in 0.5 $< Fr <$ 4, where gravity plays a major role unlike \cite{bush2004collision,bremond2006atomization}.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figure3}
	\caption{Transition to the steady state fluid-links chain formed by collision of laminar jets. The figure illustrates the transient period through the temporal advancement from (a) pre-collision symmetric jets to $T (\frac{u_jt}{d_j}) = $ (b) 1.5, (c) 4, (d) 5, (e) 5.5, (f) 6.5, (g) 8.5, (h) 16.5, (i) and (j) 20}
	\label{Figure::transient}
\end{figure}
In absence of surface tension or at very high Weber number, the sheet will keep on expanding (Figures~\ref{Figure::transient}d and~\ref{Figure::transient}e), leading to the formation of the open rim structures \citep{taylor1960formation,chen2013high}. As the sheet closes onto itself, the two rims at the periphery undergo a second oblique collision (Figure~\ref{Figure::transient}f) at an angle smaller than the initial collision (Figure~\ref{Figure::transient}b). After the secondary impingement, similar to Figure~\ref{Figure::transient}c, a flow biased sheet begins to develop (Figure~\ref{Figure::transient}g). Formation of this secondary link has no effect on the characteristics features of the primary link as the sheet speed is supercritical \citep{bush2004collision}, and therefore can be independently studied. Temporal advancement results in the formation of a full-fledged secondary link as shown in Figure~\ref{Figure::transient}h. It must be noted that the plane of formation of this sheet is orthogonal to that of the primary link and therefore the secondary link shares the same plane as the axes of the jets. The process continues and a series of mutually orthogonal links are obtained, successively reducing in size until a long single liquid jet is formed \citep{bush2004collision}. After the initial transients, links become steady $\left(T\right. \left(\frac{u_jt}{d_j}\right) $ = 8.5 as representation in primary link$\left.\right)$ which has been analyzed further. \\
Jets progress towards each other and collide at a point in the median sheet plane to form a sheet bounded by leaf-like rims. Fast moving, the thin sheet possess radial velocity pattern emerging from a stagnation point, $\delta s$ higher than the impingement location. \cite{inamura2014effect} have established $\delta s = \lambda d_j/(2\sin\alpha)$, where the factor $\lambda$ is a function of the impingement angle. Considering $\delta s$ and velocity vectors obtained from numerical simulations for two sets of non-dimensional numbers, flow pattern inside the sheet is reported in Figure~\ref{Figure::velocityVectors}a. It can be observed that velocity vectors follow a self-similar smooth path, as traced by sheet boundary. An increase of sheet span can be also noticed from the figure for an improved velocity of impacting jets.  
An effort has been made to observe the steady average flow $\left(u_f(r,\theta)\right)$ across the thickness of the sheet at a given radial and azimuthal point. It can be expressed as Equation~\ref{Equation::uf}. 
%$u_f(r,\theta) = \int_{0}^{1}\sqrt{V_iV_i}d(Y/h)$. 
\begin{equation}\label{Equation::uf}
u_f(r,\theta) = \int_{0}^{1}\sqrt{V_iV_i}d(Y/h)
\end{equation}
Variation of $u_f(r,\theta)$ along radial plane at different azimuthal angles have been shown in Figure~\ref{Figure::velocityVectors}b. It can be observed that the order of change in the fluid velocity across the radial distance from the point of impact is less than the change across the azimuthal direction \citep{choo2002velocity}. Further, sheet velocity $\left(u_s(\theta)\right)$ along a radial plane has been also obtained by integrating $u_f(r,\theta)$ as: %$u_s(\theta) = \int_{0}^{1}u_f(r,\theta)d(r/r_{max})$.
\begin{equation}\label{Equation::us}
u_s(\theta) = \int_{0}^{1}u_f(r,\theta)d(r/r_{max})
\end{equation} 
Upon non-dimensionalization of sheet velocity with its average $\left(u_0\right)$, a self-similar behavior in azimuthal direction is observed for a wide diversity of non-dimensional parameters reported in Figure~\ref{Figure::velocityVectors}(c). In this figure, four arbitrarily chosen parameters are shown which adheres to a function relationship of $u_s(\theta)$ in the following fashion: 
\begin{equation}\label{Equation::usu0}
\frac{u_s(\theta)}{u_0} = 1.03 + 0.13\cos\left(\frac{4.18\theta}{\pi}\right)
\end{equation}
Once the average sheet velocity exceeds a critical value, the chain structure is no longer stable as the  Kelvin - Helmholtz instability kicks in \citep{villermaux2002life}. \\

	\label{Figure::streamDetails}
\end{figure}
An overall look of three-dimensional chain structure (Figure~\ref{Figure::streamDetails}c) allows us to obtain velocity patterns at different axial locations. The streamlines follow steadily the phase contour boundary, with those inside the chain structure going in trajectories similar to the outer boundary as shown in Figures~\ref{Figure::streamDetails}a and~\ref{Figure::streamDetails}e. Figure~\ref{Figure::streamDetails}b puts an effort towards highlighting velocity vectors at primary, secondary and tertiary links. One can observe from Figure~\ref{Figure::streamDetails}b that the spread of liquid influence at collision planes is reducing continuously as $X/d_j$ increases.  At $X/d_j$ = 0, the liquid jets converge onto themselves (B-B') marked by retracting velocity field, whereas the liquid sheet grows (A-A') in the Z direction, marked by an expanding velocity field. Similar trends are observed at all collision planes \textbf{($X/d_j$ = 6.4, 12.5 and 18.45)} leading to the formation of three visible links in this case (Figure~\ref{Figure::streamDetails}c). The velocity vector magnitudes go on increasing at each subsequent collision planes as the gravitational head is converted to dynamic head leading to narrowing of the extent of liquid phase boundary in the XZ plane. In the primary link, this converging-diverging trend is continued from above the first collision point to the plane where the extent of the link perpendicular to the net flow direction in the plane of the link is maximum. As illustrated in Figure~\ref{Figure::streamDetails}d, the streamlines at the location of maximum width imply that the component of velocity perpendicular to the liquid sheet phase boundary is zero ($\frac{d\Psi}{dn}$ = 0). This results in the formation of distinguished circulation patterns inside the lobes at the locations of the maximum extent corresponding to the three links visible in this case. Reduction of collision strength at different planes explains diminishing spans of the links, which can be also seen from sheet cross-sectional images (Figure~\ref{Figure::streamDetails}(d)). A characteristic twist can be found in streamlines (Figure~\ref{Figure::streamDetails}f) as the flow propagates downstream through the locations of subsequent collisions. The twist occurs as the fluid parcels are restricted by surface tension to follow the chain outer periphery. These twists are prominent until viscous effects take charge and only a single jet of liquid is left at the end of the chain structure. These viscous forces lead to dissipation of energy as the liquids jets (or rims for the post-primary link) collide with each other. It is clear from our discussions above that, different flow parameters, characterized by non-dimensional numbers play a crucial role in the determination of the three-dimensional stable chain structures and therefore, the next section is devoted to analyzing such effects.

\section{Assessment of factors influencing chain structure}

In the last inset figure (from the left), comparison between the  correlation and experimental results of \cite{bush2004collision} is provided.  }
	\label{Figure::phaseContours}
\end{figure}
Formation of liquid sheet bounded by rim is governed by inertia, viscous, buoyancy and surface forces apart from angle of impingement between jets ($\alpha$). Combination of these forces forms three non-dimensional numbers ($Fr$, $Bo$ and $Re/Fr$), described above. In this section, critical assessment of chain shapes is investigated for a wide range of non-dimensional numbers and impingement angle. \cite{yang2014liquid} acknowledged the importance of these parametric variations on collision process and formation of first link. Figures~\ref{Figure::phaseContours}a -~\ref{Figure::phaseContours}d show numerical chain structure for a range of $\alpha$, $Fr$, $Bo$ and $Re/Fr$. Increase in impingement angle leads to decrement in jet momentum in direction of gravity ($u_j\cos\alpha$) and that perpendicular to the median plane increases, leading to substantial increase in width of the sheet, keeping the length more or less intact (Figures~\ref{Figure::phaseContours}a). On the other hand, as the jet momentum is increased (increase of $Fr$), the resulting links formed bigger in size (Figure~\ref{Figure::phaseContours}b) accommodating expansion tendencies due to fluid inertia. One can clearly see that this effect is transmitted to the subsequent links as well. Further, surface tension is an important entity which keeps a check on the expansion tendencies of the link. As the surface tension is decreased ($Bo$ increased), the link can expand until inertial and centrifugal forces balance it. This justifies obtaining larger links for higher values of $Bo$ as seen in Figures~\ref{Figure::phaseContours}c. As the surface tension is increased keeping all other parameters constant (low $Bo$ regime), the system tries to go towards the minimum surface energy decreasing the dimensions of the corresponding links (link in Figure~\ref{Figure::phaseContours}c from $Bo$ = 6 to 1). Further, collision of cylindrical jets and rims is also observed to be influenced by viscous dissipations. Keeping all other parameters constant, decreasing the viscosity (increasing $Re/Fr$) leads to considerable increase in sheet dimensions but its effect saturates at lower rangers of liquid viscosities (Figure~\ref{Figure::phaseContours}d). Effect of change in liquid viscosity dies down as inertia and surface tension overshadows its resistance to form similar shape and sizes of links. It can also be noticed that it is the viscous dissipations that result in decrement in the size of subsequent links leading to a point where the sheet looses its identity, giving rise to a single jet of fluid. The effect is prominent in Figure~\ref{Figure::phaseContours}d for $Re/Fr$ = 12.5.

Considering $\Delta Z$ is the rim to rim distance at a particular vertical location ($X$) of symmetric sheet, a third order polynomial is used to fit ($R^2 > 0.975$; $SSE < 0.01$) the sheet shape for a wide range of influencing parameters. Functional form of the polynomial is as follows: 
\begin{equation}\label{Equation::correlation}
\frac{\Delta Z}{2d_j} = \sum_{n = 0}^{n = 3}p_n\left(\frac{X}{d_j}\right)^n
\end{equation}
Efforts are also made to relate polynomial coefficients with non-dimensional numbers using linear Regression analysis. Hence, coefficients ($p_n$) can be expressed as
\begin{equation}\label{Equation::CorelationCoefficeints}
p_n = C_{0,n}\left(\sin\alpha\right)^{C_{1,n}}\left(Fr\right)^{C_{2,n}}\left(Bo\right)^{C_{3,n}}\left(Re/Fr\right)^{C_{4,n}}
\end{equation}
Values of $C_{m,n}$ in Equation~\ref{Equation::CorelationCoefficeints} are tabulated in Table~\ref{Table::CorrelationPrams} obeying goodness of regression norm higher than 0.925. Predictability of the correlation with numerical chain contours are shown in inset of Figure~\ref{Figure::phaseContours}e for two different cases of non-dimensional numbers. It can be also observed from Figure~\ref{e} that developed correlation gives a very good match ($\pm 5\%$) with the numerical sheet profiles. In order to check the capability of the correlation, for prediction of experimental profiles of the chain structure, comparison is made between observation of \cite{bush2004collision} and Equation~\ref{Equation::correlation}. Reported excellent match in inset of Figure~\ref{Figure::phaseContours}e proves the universality of the developed correlation. It is essential to understand the formation physics of widely influenced sheet structure generated due to collision of jets. Next section dedicatedly discusses the issue.
\section{Analytical Model}	
To understand the physical insights of liquid jet collision, idealizations are made for tracing back the sheet profile as a resultant of collision between two billiard balls (mass $m$) in the plane of the sheet. Follow up trajectory of the balls after collision is considered to be damped in order to mimic resistive forces like viscous and surface tension. A free body diagram and schematic of the billiard ball collision assumption to replicate the sheet structure is depicted in Figure~\ref{Figure::analytical}c. Apart from inertial and gravitational forces, on the ball, a damping force of magnitude $f_n$ is also attached in the direction perpendicular to the individual ball, post collision. Use of $f_n$ is supposed to impose the effect of viscous dissipation and surface forces. Absence of these resistive forces will make infinitely stretched sheet \citep{taylor1960formation}, with $f_n$ = 0 case. Reference frame for the trajectory of the ball ($\zeta$) is considered to have origin at point of collision with $\zeta$ = 0 at $X$ = 0.
Free body force analysis of the ball, post collision can be expressed as Equation~\ref{Equation::forceBal}.
\begin{subequations}
	\label{Equation::forceBal}	
	\begin{eqnarray}
	\label{Equation::tangential(a)}
	\text{Direction t:}\:\:\: v_{ball}\frac{dv_{ball}}{ds} &=& g\cos\phi\\
	\text{Direction n:}\:\:\: mg\sin\phi + f_n &=& m\frac{v_{ball}^2}{r_c}
	\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
Here, $r_c$ is the radius of curvature in $\zeta-X$ plane and $\phi = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{d\zeta}{dX}\right)$. Integrating tangential momentum equation with increment $ds = \frac{dX}{\cos\phi}$ along with boundary condition at $X$ = 0, instantaneous ball velocity ($v_{ball}$) can be obtained as $\sqrt{u_j^2 + 2gX}$. Rearrangement of momentum equation in the normal direction after defining $\Lambda$ as $\frac{f_n}{mg}$ and inertial length scale, $\chi$ equivalent to $\frac{v_{ball}^2}{2g}$, one obtains:
\begin{equation}\label{Equation::Final1}
r_c\left(\sin\phi + \Lambda\right) = 2\chi\left(\frac{X}{\chi} + 1\right)
\end{equation} 
After necessary integration, Equation~\ref{Equation::Final1} simplifies to:
\begin{equation}
\sin\phi  = \sin\alpha + \left(\Lambda + \sin\alpha\right)\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{X}{\chi} + 1}} - 1\right)	
\end{equation}
Recalling that $\tan\phi = \frac{d\zeta}{dX}$ and expressing $\frac{\Lambda}{\sin\alpha} = \eta$, profile of billiard ball movement can be characterized as:
\begin{equation}
\label{Equation::AnaFinal}
\frac{d\zeta}{dX} = \tan\left\lbrace\sin^{-1}\left[ \sin\phi_0\left(1 + \eta\right)\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{X}{\chi} + 1}} - 1\right) \right]\right\rbrace

Functional form of the ball trajectory, equivalence of sheet profile, can be integrated numerically to obtain the coordinate points in $\zeta-X$ plane after tuning only control factor, $\eta$ from some simulated profiles. In this process, $L^1$ relative error norm is kept below 10\%. Efforts have been also made to express control parameter, $\eta$ in terms of non-dimensional numbers for range of values presented in this work. With 99\% $R^2$ regression norm, $\eta$ can be related with non-dimensional numbers as:
\begin{equation}\label{Equation::eta}
\eta = 3.28(\sin\alpha)^{-0.077}(Fr)^{0.418}(Bo)^{-0.248}\left(Re/Fr\right)^{-0.084}
\end{equation}

In Figure (c), the schematic of this analytical model is shown.}

Proposed concept of collision of billiard balls for mimicking the sheet profile is also tested with phase contours of numerical simulations. Some representative matches are shown in Figure~\ref{Figure::analytical}b to~\ref{Figure::analytical}e in connection of primary link. Fundamental analysis of forces, single controlling parameter in sheet profile (Equation~\ref{Equation::AnaFinal}) and excellent match with numerical data supplies in-depth knowledge about genesis of liquid chain. Next, we focus on the mutual relationship between links formed at successive orthogonal planes.
