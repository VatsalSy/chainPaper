\section{Introduction}
Interactions of liquid jets have invoked the curiosity of researchers with their ubiquitous presence, eminent even in the scientific artworks by Leonardo Da Vinci in the 16$^{th}$ century. Physics of different types of interactions related to liquid jets is classically summarized in a recent effort by \cite{eggers2008physics}. One of these interactions is the collision between liquid jets, presented by \cite{rayleigh1879capillary}. \cite{bush2004collision} introduced several regimes to characterize the different flow structures obtained from such collisions, working on the theory of liquid jet impingement given by \cite{taylor1960formation}. At low velocities or narrow angles of impingement, jets may coalesce to form a unified one or bounce off due to presence of a thin film of air between them \citep{wadhwa2013noncoalescence}. On increasing the flow rates, laminar jets may lead to formation of a stable liquid sheet bounded by a thick rim \citep{yang2014liquid}. Inertia and gravitational forces act to expand the liquid sheet formed but the action of surface tension puts a check and allows the sheet  to converge, such that the successive collisions of the thick rims downstream of the flow result in formation of mutually orthogonal liquid sheets \citep{bush2004collision}. Figure~\ref{Figure::schematic}a illustrates this structure termed as the liquid chain with the complementary orthogonal sheets forming the different links. Alternatively, further increase in jet velocity, due to several instability modes, leads towards ejection of droplets from the liquid rim \citep{bremond2006atomization}, fluid fishbones \citep{bush2004collision} and flapping sheet \citep{villermaux2002life} associated with atomized drops \citep{ibrahim1991impinging}. The stable chain regime is not just an idealization of the violent flapping, but also holds physical significance for the exploration of fundamental physics behind atomization. Moreover, these structures can be used as wall-free continuous reactors \citep{erni2013free} and are often used as a canonical arrangement for generation of liquid sheets \citep{dombrowski1954photographic}. \\

\end{figure}
Keeping this fascinating applications in mind, a range of  experimental works can be found exploring the formation of stable liquid sheets using viscous jets \citep{choo2001parametric,choo2002velocity,bush2004collision,inamura2014effect}. Using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique, radial streamlines are observed near the point of impingement and the fluid parcels travel towards the periphery resulting in the formation of the thick rim due to fluid accumulation \citep{choo2002velocity,bush2004collision}. The rim is stable as long as the curvature force developed by surface tension provides the necessary centripetal acceleration as the fluid packets in the rim accelerate owing to loss in gravitational potential \citep{bremond2006atomization}. On balancing the two, \cite{taylor1960formation} developed an expression for the sheet radius which has been found to describe the experimental results of \cite{bush2004collision} reasonably well. Emphasis has been also given by \cite{bush2004collision} for prediction of shapes of leaf like links forming chain structure. However, the model requires input from the experiments so as to close the system of differential equations. Isolated numerical efforts are also found describing different possible outcomes due to liquid jets interactions. As a part of their study, \cite{ma2011atomization,chen2013high} have shown formation of liquid chain using Finite Volume based Volume of Fluid (VOF) network. Recently, \cite{da2016surface} also demonstrated formation of liquid chain using Boundary Element Method (BEM). But, their exhibition of chain like structure along with other physical jet related structures suffer from inviscid assumption.\\
Critical assessment of literature reveals that an in-depth study of fluid chain regime is still due which can explore fundamental physics behind formation of primary link and establish relation between successive diminishing links. Major challenge that lies in the prediction of chain like structure is the proper resolution of sheet (approximately $1/100^{th}$ of jet diameter) between the rims, which are supposed to mingle once again for forming next link in mutually perpendicular plane. Figure~\ref{Figure::schematic}b is presented to demonstrate the presence of a range of length scales in such a simplistic fluid link. In the present work, we attempt at study of an overall behavior of the fluid chain  while focusing on the physics of flow for the primary link by analyzing the dimensional characteristics and velocity fields. Special attention is given to the second and third collisions, leading to the formation of the subsequent mutually orthogonal links and relate them from fundamental force balance. In the next section, the numerical framework employed in this work is briefly explained before reporting mesh sensitivity analysis and validation.

\section{Numerical framework}
Collision of liquid jets has been studied using three-dimensional two-phase flow simulations using the finite volume framework for discretization and Volume Of Fluid (VOF) approach for interface tracking. Open source time-dependent, multi-fluid Navier-Stokes solver, Gerris is used for the current study \citep{Popinet2003}. It invokes an adaptive mesh projection method for solution of incompressible continuity and momentum equations. The spatial discretization of the domain is undertaken using an octree based structured hierarchical grid system, which can be locally refined. Conventional mass and momentum conservation equations for incompressible flow has been solved in presence of interface specific surface tension force ($\sigma \kappa$, where $\sigma$ is the surface tension coefficient and $\kappa$ denotes the curvature of the interface) and gravitational field ($\rho g$).  The interface tracking is undertaken using the Volume Of Fluid (VOF) approach using volume fraction (tracer) defined as $\Psi(x_i,t)$, at the spatial and temporal instance of $x_i$ and $t$ respectively. Therefore, the density and viscosity for the study can be defined by Equation~\ref{Equation::general}.
\begin{equation} \label{Equation::general}
A (\Psi) = \Psi A_1 + (1-\Psi)A_2 \: \: \:  \forall  \: A \in \{\rho, \mu\}
\end{equation}
The Volume of Fluid approach implemented is a two-step process of interface reconstruction (based on the values of $\Psi$ and piecewise linear interface construction scheme, PLIC) along with geometric flux computation and interface advection (Equation~\ref{Equation::vof}).
\begin{equation} \label{Equation::vof}
\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial(\Psi V_i)}{\partial X_i} = 0
\end{equation}
Second order accurate time discretization of momentum and continuity equations are carried out with time splitting algorithm as proposed by \cite{Chorin1968}, whereby an unconditionally stable corrector predictor time marching approach is adopted. A multi-grid solver is used for solution of the resulting pressure-velocity coupled Laplace equation. The advection term of the momentum equation $\left(V_k\frac{\partial V_i}{\partial X_k}\right)$ is estimated using the Bell-Colella-Glaz second-order unsplit upwind scheme \citep{bell1989second}, which requires the restriction to be set up on the time step between subsequent outer iterations based on the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) stability criteria as the estimation is stable only for CFL $<$ 1 \cite{popinet2009}. The details of the octree-based multi-level solver employed for the solution of the system of the equations can be found in the works of \cite{Popinet2003,popinet2009}. \\ 
Figure~\ref{Figure::schematic}a illustrates the computational domain with parabolic inflow (average velocity, $u_j$) of jets (diameter, $d_j$ and impingement angle, $2\alpha$) and boundary outflow elsewhere. It is necessary to capture the smallest features of the flow, in this case, the thickness of the liquid sheet. From the works of \cite{hasson1964thickness,poulikakos1998thickness,choo2001parametric}, it can be easily shown that the thickness of liquid sheet follows $\frac{hr}{d_j^2} \sim 1$, for $2\alpha \in \{0,\pi/2\}$. The minimum thickness is present immediately upstream of the second collision point (Figure~\ref{Figure::schematic}b and~\ref{Figure::gisetal}b(iii)). Therefore, $\frac{d_j}{\delta l} \sim 10\frac{r_{max}}{d_j}$ can be used as an imperative starting point for the grid independence study. The factor of 10 is included to have at least 10 grid points across the smallest length scale for the structure to be fully resolved \citep{ling2015multiscale}, else the sheet thickness will be equal to the minimum grid size and the sheet would break at the cost of being unresolved \citep{chen2013high}. Applying above discussed arguments, $\frac{d_j}{\delta l} \sim 70$ should be ideal for the simulations. It can be  clearly seen that the variations in the results such as the contour of the tracer (volume fraction) and velocity profiles atnear the jet inlet, saturate if the refinement is increased from $\frac{d_j}{\delta l} = 102.4$ to $204.8$ (Figure~\ref{Figure::gisetal}b). Therefore, a refinement level of $\frac{d_j}{\delta l} = 102.4$ is employed for this case. A similar analysis is carried out for all the cases reported in the present study initiated with $\frac{d_j}{\delta l} = 10\frac{r_{max}}{d_j}$, with $r_{max} = 10d_j$. If the sheet is still not fully resolved or the maximum radial extent of a given link goes higher that $10d_j$, the refinement level is increased.\\
Next, we use the experimental results obtained by \cite{bush2004collision} to validate the employed numerical model. The primary link of the chain structure formed is used to compare the experimentally obtained boundary and the contour generated from numerical simulations shown in Figure~\ref{Figure::gisetal}c. Making use of the fact that their experiments led to a supercritical (greater than the capillary wave speed) sheet speeds, \cite{bush2004collision} were able to construct the variation of the liquid volume flux $\left(Q(\theta) = \frac{dQ}{d\theta} = uhr\right)$ inside the sheet by scanning across the sheet and collecting liquid through a fine opening. Figure~\ref{Figure::gisetal}c shows the variation of the liquid flux with the azimuthal angle inside the sheet along with the reconstruction of the flux profile by our numerical simulation. Further, on performing non-dimensional analysis, it can be observed that Froude number $\left(Fr = \frac{u_j}{\sqrt{gd_j}}\right)$, Bond number $\left(Bo = \frac{\rho gd_j^2}{\sigma}\right)$ and ratio between Reynolds number and jet Froude number $\left(Re/Fr = \frac{\rho\sqrt{gd_j^3}}{\mu}\right)$ govern the shape and sizes of different links in the fluid chain structure. In our next section, detailed effort has been presented to investigate formation of chain based on above non-dimensional numbers.
